Sergio Vieira
Software Engineer and Network Researcher (sergiosvieira@gmail.com)

I always enjoyed the idea of make a computer do what I want. My first programming experience was when I had twelve years old with my old computer TK3000II. Since that, I never stopped to programming, and nowadays I still have fun learning new programming languages and improving my computer skills. During my academic period I've acquired experience in Network R&D mainly using a software called Network Simulator versions 2 and 3, and during my professional experience I've learned how to design a software architecture that is easy to maintain and how to work with a team. I love design a solution and make it be reality.

Professional Work Experience
Plain Software Engineer for FUNCEME (www.funceme.br), 2014-now
I brought to the company the culture of to work togheter using Git to control all source code changes. I worked a lot with C++ progamming language using wxWidget in Windows Platform (Visual Studio). I was responsible to reformulate all canvas interface using computer graphics concepts of a software called SIGA (http://www.funceme.br/siga). This way was possible to load huges hidrologic network models. I worked with GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) to improve a method used to calculate the rainfall average in a Basin (Thiessen Method). I worked a lot with CMake to create a multiplatform version of SIGA. I improved the performance of the open project method. All of this changes improved the overall performace of the SIGA and it will be used by a main governament institution of water allocation resources in Brazil.
Skills: Software and System Architecture, Git, SVN, C++, wxWidgets, CMake, Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, Visual Studio, GDAL.

Academic Experience
Master Degree in Computer Science (State University of Ceara) - 2010-2012
My master degree was mainly focused in Computer Networks. The field of study was related with Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET), Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Fuzzy Logic. In my thesis, I created a new VANET/DTN Network protocol using Fuzzy Logic on Network Simulator 3 (C++). I got good experimental results how you can see on paper publicated on AICT 2013 (https://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiKyrTp0v7KAhXIh5AKHXXxCUcQFgggMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkmind.org%2Fdownload.php%3Farticleid%3Daict_2013_6_40_10209&usg=AFQjCNEUUVcTKVgrrWrdFHvl1TwdiKJgIA&sig2=Qv4bXL422XBJnHjlRWKQMw)
